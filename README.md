# Simple-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a small and simple Rock Paper Scissors game meant to improve my javascript skills.
It currently shows the computers choice (which is random) and the users choice but not the result.
I might style it in the future when I get everything to work but for now it will stay bare-bones.
