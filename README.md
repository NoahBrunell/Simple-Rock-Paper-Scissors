# Simple-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a small and simple Rock Paper Scissors game meant to improve my javascript skills.
It currently shows the computers choice (which is random) and the users choice but not the result just yet.
I might style it in the future when I get everything to work but for now it will stay bare-bones.
